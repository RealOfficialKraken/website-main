            <p>
                My experience with OpenGOAL and it's community was unique beyond measure.
                I can't believe it happened the way it did, and I couldn't ask for anything more.

                OpenGOAL is an engine originally created by Naughty Dog, named the GOAL engine. 
                OpenGOAL works the same way, except it's entirely open-sourced, hence "OpenGOAL".
                <p>
                    The projects I created were my introductions to creating content for a whole audience, who all loved and cherished this 20 year old game, just as I do.

                            The following projects had set "goals" in mind, like better functionality in the long run (as the game got updated more). I had already known some code, but still had no idea how to "program".
                            I had spent long nights figuring out different solutions to the problems I had, and it really helped me when I started actually creating processes.

        <ol>Kraken's current mods on OpenGOAL:
            <li>Jak II Hero Mode+ Mod<p><a href="https://jakmods.dev"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8TqlZDO.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>
            This mod was my first experience with the project as a whole. 
            It was the first mod to come out when Jak II released for OpenGOAL to open beta.
            I tinkered with so many things, I personally think it was a complete mess. 
            However, people seemed to love everything about it, regardless of it being harder. 
            Here's a brief synopsis of the description:
            <p>
                Overhauls Jak II's difficulty, but with a twist! Adds weapon mods, custom modifiers, hero mode changes, and various other things to find! Are you up for the challenge?
            </p>
        </li>
            <li>Rogue-Like Jak II
                <p><a href="https://jakmods.dev"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kLzjswt.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>
                I had this idea cooking for a while before I went and programmed it.
                It was the first time I was establishing systems that worked with one-another, aside from HeroMode+ which was just a bunch of "when" statements.
                It was refreshing to know that everything I had done to change up the game was really well-recieved.
                It even recieved comments like "extra dlc for Jak II", or "this is absolutely the way the game should have been played."
                Here's a brief synposis of the description:
                <p>
                    The Jak Time Loop is broken! To restore it, Jak must fight through random missions that grow more unstable the further you venture. As the enemies get stronger, so can you! With Vin's help, Jak must blast his way back into the metalhead nest, and restore his destiny.
