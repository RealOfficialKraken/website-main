    <p>Heyo! My name is Matthew Krueger, I was born on June 18th in Columbus, Ohio in 1999. My older sibling Joey was 5 at the time, excited to see he finally had a little brother.
        Our family had always moved around considering my father's career in Film Production. So when I was 2, we moved to Oceanside, California.
        We jumped around the southern side like Menifee, Temecula, and Murrieta throughout the years. </p>
        <p>My favorite music is melodic, any genre that pulls this off, pulls me in.</p>
        <p>My favorite take-out food is In-N-Out Burger, and my favorite dish is Chicken Risotto, and/or a Medium Rare Porterhouse.</p>
        <p>My favorite types of video games are puzzle/over-arching stories.</p>
        <p>My favorite story narratives are meta types</p>
        <p>I am exceptional at competing in Rocket League, and at my peak, I was the top 0.02% of players on the ranked leaderboard. Grand Champion was my highest rank at 1613 MMR</p>
        <p>I think the best expression of myself can be exhibited through the art that I do. I love making things. The concept of Head to Tangibility has been a huge interest for me for all of my life.</p>
        <p></p>

            This is a picture of my whole family. That's me, in the flannel. I've always had an over-active imagination, constantly creating things in the gargantuan mindscape I call my head. 
            My mother, on the other hand, called it "Matthew's World". In 2002, my family bought us a Playstation 2, and my older brother and I couldn't be more excited.
            My very first video game title, Jak and Daxter, was a completely revolutionary game at the time. The game still holds near and dear to my heart, to this day
             (see <a href="/portfolio-website/website-main/pages/page-opengoal.html">here</a> for more details). I believe Joey said I ended up beating it when I was 5 years old.
