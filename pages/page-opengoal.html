                    My experience with OpenGOAL and it's community was unique beyond measure. 
                    It's why I created a page for it exclusively. 
                    Working on mods for all of the Jak and Daxter games gave me experience in PROGRAMMING, and not just coding. 
                    I got to make my own processes and functions, macros and objects. I also learned pacing, story design, and playtesting to fix bugs effectively before launch, as well as a ton of GitHub experience.
                    All of my work seemed greatly anticipated, and very well recieved by the community.
                    I can't believe it happened the way it did, and I couldn't ask for anything more.

                    OpenGOAL is an engine originally created by Naughty Dog back in 2001, named the GOAL engine (Game Oriented Assembly Lisp). 
                    The source code was able to be found and reconstructed on PC, making it open-sourced. Hence, OpenGOAL. Check out <a href="https://opengoal.dev">here</a> for more details.
                    <p>
                        Every mod's end "goal" was to completely change up the game in every aspect I could think of. By utilizing the systems already in place, I was able to play around and experiment with a ton of different concepts.
                        When I found a really fun concept, I would finish by going as far as I could to make as many "WOW!" factors as I could. 
                        Then, I would bug fix like crazy, and release the mod for everyone to enjoy!

                                The following projects had set <a href="https://opengoal.dev" style="color:yellow; text-decoration: none;">goal</a>s in mind, like better functionality in the long run (as the game got updated more).
                                For example, my very first mod was just switching things around, while still experimenting for a good idea. Not a single line of code was written. THIS, was what helped me <a style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-style:oblique;">understand</a>
                                the structure of the game's code.

            <p><h3>Jak II Hero Mode+ Mod</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/RealOfficialKraken/OG-HeroMode-Plus"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8TqlZDO.png" title="source: imgur.com" style="width: 25%; height: 25%;"/></a></p>
            This mod was my first experience with the project as a whole. 
            It was the first mod to come out when Jak II released for OpenGOAL to open beta.
            I tinkered with so many things, I personally think it was a complete mess. 
            However, people seemed to love everything about it, regardless of it being harder. 
            Here's a brief synopsis of the description:
            <p>
                Overhauls Jak II's difficulty, but with a twist! Adds weapon mods, custom modifiers, hero mode changes, and various other things to find! Are you up for the challenge?
            </p>
            <p>
                The differences in gameplay are that the enemies are a part of the traffic-manager, which is a process that spawns and despawns entities within your camera view. It's also shown on the minimap on the bottom right corner as to where these entities are, and how many. I also changed the atmosphere, added sound effects, and created a process that takes the player somewhere else once your HP reaches 0. There's also an easter egg I put that teases my next mod, with an over-arching story:

            <p><h3>Rogue-Like Jak II</h3>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/RealOfficialKraken/RoguelikeJak2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kLzjswt.png" title="source: imgur.com" style="width: 25%; height: 25%;" /></a></p>
                I had this idea cooking for a while before I went and programmed it.
                It was the first time I was establishing systems that worked with one-another, aside from HeroMode+ which was just a bunch of "when" statements.
                It was refreshing to know that everything I had done to change up the game was really well-recieved.
                It even recieved comments like "extra dlc for Jak II", or "this is absolutely the way the game should have been played."
                Here's a brief synposis of the description:
                <p>
                    The Jak Time Loop is broken! To restore it, Jak must fight through random missions that grow more unstable the further you venture. As the enemies get stronger, so can you! With Vin's help, Jak must blast his way back into the metalhead nest, and restore his destiny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's a full playthrough of the mod, blind-played by a streamer/speedrunner of the Jak series:
